# MCU_practice – STM32F4 Embedded Systems Project

This project is a collection of hands-on exercises and implementations based on the **STM32F446RE Nucleo board** using **bare-metal programming** and **STM32 HAL drivers**. It is part of the **MCU2 course** from FastBit Embedded Brain Academy and focuses on building deep expertise in microcontroller peripherals such as **Timers**, **PWM**, **CAN**, **RTC**, and **Low Power Modes**.

> 🔧 Code is written from scratch (not auto-generated by STM32CubeMX) to help master peripheral internals and the HAL framework.
